# Sequential Fair Allocation With Replenishments: A Little Envy Goes An Exponentially Long Way

In this repository we include all of the code used for generating the figures and numerical simulations.

## Supplementary Files
- `helper.py` implements all of the algorithms and helper functions to evaluate the efficiency and fairness on different donation and demand distributions

## Figure Files
- `create_Delta_plot.py` creates the figure comparing efficiency versus $\Delta$
- `create_M_plot.py` creates the figure comparing efficiency versus $M$

## Running a Simulation
- `run_data.py` runs the simulations on the synthetic data
- `run_multi_resource.py` runs the simulations on the multi-resource multi-type case
